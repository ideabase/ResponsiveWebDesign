<h3 id="about-this-course">About This Course</h3>
<p>Responsive web design isn’t just a technical solution for web design - it’s an entire process that brings multiple disciplines together to form one product that works across multiple devices.  The responsive design process includes user experience, content strategy, information architecture, visual design, development, usability testing and technical testing.  Students who will succeed in this field will need to be familiar with not just one, but all of these processes, while working in a team-based environment.</p>
<p>In this course you will learn the fundamental principles for developing standards-based web sites from a mobile-first and content-first perspective.  We will explore each aspect of an agile-inspired process, during which you’ll learn each step of what it takes to build a website and ensure its functionality for its users in terms of both usability and performance.</p>

<h3 style="clear: left;">Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>We'll be covering many topics during class, as well as working in groups on exercises to help you master web design techniques.  Therefore, attending each of the 15 classes is crucial.  I will allow <strong>two missed classes</strong> for the semester.  All subsequent absences will only be accepted for the following reasons:  sickness (with medical note only), athletic event (with coach's note), religious observation, military responsibility (with documentation) and death in the family (with documentation).  </p>
<p>Students who miss more than two classes without proper documentation will receive a 0 for their class participation grade for the semester.</p>
<p>If you miss class, you are still responsible for contacting the instructor to see what was assigned that day, as well as meeting all assignment deadlines.</p>
<p>Some assignments, such as in-class presentations, testing and quizzes, require attendance in order to receive full credit for the assignment.</p>
<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>
<p>The assignments deadlines are to help you manage the workload and stay on track with the course. If an assignment will be late, students must contact the instructor and explain. Kent State accepts the following reasons for late assignments: sickness with medical note, athletic event (with coach’s note), religious observation, military responsibility (with documentation), death in the family (with documentation).</p>
<p>My policy for late assignments has 3 rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Late assignments will be accepted so long as you contact the instructor to indicate that it will be late and provide an explanation.</li>
<li>Late assignments must be submitted within 1 week of the original due date, without penalty, so long as the student meets the first rule. After 1 week the assignment will be marked as 0.</li>
<li>An additional extension may be possible in exceptional circumstances, with documentation. This requires a face-to-face conversation between the student and the instructor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-work">Group Work</h3>
<p>This class uses team-based learning for part or all of the semester.  Students must agree to follow the <a href="../groups/policies">Group Rules &amp; Expectations</a> throughout the course of the project.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Final letter grades will be assigned on the basis of the following table.  Graduate student assignments will take into account additional advanced components (described within the assignment), differing from undergraduate assignments.</p>

<h3 id="university-policies-and-procedures">University Policies and Procedures</h3>
<p>The following policies and procedures apply to students enrolled at Kent State University. For a complete listing of university policies, please visit the Policy Register page on the Kent State University website.</p>
<h4 id="course-enrollment-and-withdrawal">Course enrollment and withdrawal</h4>
<p>University policy requires all students to be officially registered in each class they are attending. Students who are not officially registered for a course by published deadlines should not be attending classes and will not receive credit or a grade for the course. Each student must confirm enrollment by checking his/her class schedule (using Student Tools in FlashFast) prior to the deadline indicated. Registration errors must be corrected prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>Every class has its own schedule of deadlines and considerations. To view the add/drop schedule and other important dates for this class, go to the Student Category / Dashboard / in  FlashLine  and choose View or Print Course Schedule and Purchase Textbooks link. To see the deadlines for this course, click on the CRN or choose the Add or drop a Course link in the Student Category / Resources Page / Courses and Registration section and click on the green clock next to the course under Registration Deadlines.</p>
<h4 id="incomplete-grades">Incomplete grades</h4>
<p>The administrative mark of IN (Incomplete) may be given to students who are unable to complete the work due to extenuating circumstances. To be eligible, undergraduate students must be currently passing and have completed at least 12 weeks of the semester. Graduate students must be currently earning a C or better grade and are unable to complete the required work between the course withdrawal deadline and the end of classes. The time line shall be adjusted appropriate for summer sessions and flexibly scheduled courses.  Appropriate documentation is generally required to support the extenuating circumstance. The student must initiate the request for the Incomplete mark from the instructor, and it is the responsibility of the student to arrange to make up the incomplete work. Incomplete grades must be made up within one semester (not including summer sessions) for undergraduate students and one calendar year for graduate students. Unless the course is completed or an extension is granted, incomplete grades will automatically lapse to the grade designated on the Incomplete Mark Form at the end of one semester for undergraduate students and at the end of one year for graduate students.</p>
<h4 id="university-use-of-electronic-mail">University use of electronic mail</h4>
<p>A university-assigned student email account shall be an official university means of communication with all students at Kent State University. Students are responsible for all information sent to them via their university-assigned email account. If a student chooses to forward information in their university email account, he or she is responsible for all information, including attachments, sent to any other email account. To stay current with university information, students are expected to check their official university email account and other electronic communications on a frequent and consistent basis. Recognizing that some communications may be time-critical, the university recommends that electronic communications be checked minimally twice a week.</p>
<h4 id="plagiarism-and-academic-integrity">Plagiarism and academic integrity</h4>
<p>Students enrolled in the university, at all its campuses, are to perform their academic work according to standards set by faculty members, departments, schools and colleges of the university; and cheating and plagiarism constitute fraudulent misrepresentation for which no credit can be given and for which appropriate sanctions are warranted and will be applied. For more information: <a href="http://www.kent.edu/plagiarism">http://www.kent.edu/plagiarism</a>.</p>
<h4 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with disabilities</h4>
